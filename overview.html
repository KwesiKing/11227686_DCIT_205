<h2>PROFILE</h2>
<p>

<p>The Legon campus lies about 13 kilometres north-east of Accra, the capital of Ghana, at an altitude of between 300 and 400 feet. From the Main University Gate on the National Highway 4 (N4), the University Avenue extends to Commonwealth Hall on Legon Hill.</p>
<p>Halls of residence, departments, lecture theatres and laboratories are grouped along the Main Avenue. Mid-way is an open space – the University Square – with an ornamental fountain overlooking the Balme Library (named after David Mowbray Balme, the first Principal of the University College). Across from the University Square are sports fields, and halls of residence.</p>
<p>Behind Commonwealth Hall is an open-air theatre with a Grecian style auditorium built into the slope of Legon Hill. On the summit of Legon Hill is the Convocation Group of Buildings which houses the University’s central administration offices, the Great Hall, with a seating capacity of 1,500 and a tower donated by the Government of Ghana in 1957 to commemorate Ghana’s Independence. On the southern side of the campus are residential accommodation for staff, the University Basic School, a Banking Square, the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, School of Public Health, Sports Stadium, student residences and the University of Ghana Medical Centre.
