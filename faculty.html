The deployment of increasing number of wireless systems will bring in its wake a number of problems including spectral congestion and the need to employ better and sophisticated frequency planning techniques. Cognitive radio has emerged as preferred way of building intelligent radio systems that are capable of interacting with their environment and making real time decisions.</div>

      <h2>Prof Isaac Wiafe</h2>
      Tools for designing persuasive technologies are becoming increasingly available with the "explosion in innovation" in areas of social networking, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence. Yet most of the current persuasive technologies available either do not make explicit the theoretical foundation upon which they are developed or do not have one at all [Torning and Oinas-Kukkonen 2009].
