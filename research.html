Faculty Spotlight: Omer Reingold, the Rajeev Motwani Professor in Computer Science
  </h3>

  <p>
    "A computer scientist teaching a theater class is a bit unusual, I’ll grant you that. But is it so strange? For me, classifying different parts of campus to left-brain-versus-right-brain kind of thinking is just an unfortunate stereotype. I'd much rather go with ‘creativity is creativity is creativity.'

    The Emmy Award-winning video looks back at a remarkable six decades of AI work at Stanford University.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Stanford has been a leader in AI almost since the day the term was dreamed up by John McCarthy in the 1950s. McCarthy would join the Stanford faculty in 1962 and found the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), initiating a six-decades-plus legacy of innovation. Over the years, the field has grown to welcome a diversity of researchers and areas of exploration, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, natural language processing, and more. All the while, Stanford has been at the forefront in research and in educating the next generation of innovators in AI. Artificial intelligence would not be what it is today without Stanford.
