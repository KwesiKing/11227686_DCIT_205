## Project Learnings

Throughout the development of website of Department of Computer Science of the University of Ghana, I have gained valuable insights and skills, including:

- **HTML:** Developed a structured and semantic layout for the website, ensuring accessibility and readability.

- **CSS:** Applied styles and layouts to enhance the visual appeal of the website, including responsive design for various screen sizes.

- **JavaScript:** Implemented small but impactful interactive features using JavaScript to enhance user experience.

This project allowed me to focus on the fundamentals of web development, honing my skills in front-end technologies. While the project scope was centered around HTML, CSS, and small JavaScript functionalities, the experience has laid a solid foundation for future projects and further exploration into the world of web development.
